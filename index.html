            <h2>Declarations</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Let</h3>
            <p>Let has block scope if it is declared in a block and global scope if it is declared outside of a block.
                Also, it not accessible before it is declared. You can not redeclare the same variable in the same
                scope.
                <code>
                    Ex. Let me = ‘Foo’; <br>
                    Let me = ‘Bar’; This would make an error. 
                </code>
            </p>
            <h3>Const</h3>
            <p>Primitives can not be changed. If you make an object with the const keyword its properties and method
                can still be added, subtracted, or changed. BUT you can not totally reassign the object to be a new
                object.
            </p>
            <h3>Var</h3>
            <p>Var has function scope if declared in a function and global scope if declared outside of a function.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data">
            <h2>Data Types</h2>

            <h3>Undefined</h3>
            <p>When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.</p>
            <h3>Null</h3>
            <p>Null is a non-existent value or a value that has been set to null.</p>
            <h3>Boolean</h3>
            <p>True or False. 1 or 0...</p>
            <p>Everything that has a value is true and everything that does not is false.</p>
            <h3>Falsy Values:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>False</li>
                <li>Null</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>0</li>
                <li>NaN</li>
                <li>" "</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>String</h3>
            <p>Strings contain text.</p>
            <h3>Number</h3>
            <p>There are integers, floating point numbers, Infinity, -Infinity, and Nan. For exponents you can
                write an e. The % symbol gives you the remainder after division.</p>
            <code>3.14e10  =  31.4<br>
                            818 % 100 = 18</code>
            <br>
            <h3>Symbol</h3>
            <p>“Symbol” value represents a unique identifier. Symbols allow us to create “hidden” properties of an
                object, that no other part of code can occasionally access or overwrite.</p>
            <h3>Object</h3>
            <p>You can create objects by grouping key value pairs. Arrays and functions are both objects.</p>

            <h3>Type Conversion</h3>
            <code>Number();</code>
            <p> Will convert the value into a number. String(); and Boolean(); will convert the value to their type.
            </p>
            <h3>Automatic Type Conversion</h3>
            <p>When null or undefined occurs on either side of the operator, it produces true only if both sides are
                one of null or undefined.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <hr>
            <code>
             function foo() { <br>
                // function scope <br>
                if (condition) { <br>
                    // block scope <br>
                  } <br>
              } <br>
            </code>
            <h3>Global Scope</h3>
            <p>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. They can be used anywhere in the
                program.
            </p>
            <h3>Function Scope</h3>
            <p>Variables declared Locally (inside a function) have Function Scope. They can only be used in the
                function they are declared in.
            </p>
            <h3>Block Scope</h3>
            <p>Variables declared with the var keyword can not have Block Scope. Variables declared inside a
                block {} can be accessed from outside the block.

        <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Unary Operators</h3>
            <p>Some operator like typeof can be use with one operator. The minus symbol can be used both as a Unary or
                Binary operator.
            </p>
            <h3>Comparisons</h3>
            <p> 3>2 = true; Only one value does not equal itself Nan. So NaN == NaN is false. NOTE: null == null and
                undefined == undefined. This makes sense with numbers but what about words? Well letters later in the
                alphabet have higher values. So a is less than b. But! Capitals have lower values. So a capital B is
                less than a lowercase a. Special characters are even lower.</p>
            <p>LOW - empty string - Punctuation - Capitals - Lowercase Letters - Later letters - HIGH</p>
            <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
            <code>
                &&- and   (true && false) = false <br>
                ||- or         (true || false) = false <br>
                !- not        Flips value.  !true is false.  !false is true. 
            </code>
            <h3>Ternary Operator</h3>
            <p>Condition ? 1 : 2. If the condition is true use the first value if not use the second.
            </p>
            <h3>Short-Circuitng of Logical Operators</h3>
            <p>The || operator, for example, will return the value to its left when that can be converted to true and
                will return the value on its right otherwise. 
                Console.log(null || “Hello”); This would log Hello because null is a false value.
            </p>
            <p>The && operator works similarly but the other way around. When the value to its left is something that
                converts to false, it returns that value, and otherwise it returns the value on its right. <br>
                “"&&"Hello" would return “” and “Something”&&"Hello" would return Hello.
            </p>
            <p>In the case of true || X, no matter what Xis—even if it’s a piece of program that does
                something terrible—the result will be true, and X is never evaluated. The same goes for false && X,
                which is false and will ignore X. This is called short-circuit evaluation.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Creating Functions</h3>
            <p>Functions have the function keyword, parameters, and then a code block. </p>
            <p>A function is created with parameters and when it is called arguments are passed into the function.</p>
            <code> function name(x, y){ <br>
                statements; <br>
                }</code>
            <p>Once you make a function to use it you need to call it.</p>
            <h3>Functions Call</h3>
            <code>name(myX, myY);</code>
            <p>This is how you call a function. myX and myY are arguments that are passed into the function. myX would
                be used inplace of x.</p>
            <h3>Function Invocation</h3>
            <p>Function invocation is when the function will be activated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Event- Caused by an event.</li>
                <li>Invoked- Invoked by JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Automatically- Self Invoked.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Function Return</h3>
            <p>Return will stop the function and return a value to it. </p>
            <code>
                function add(x,y){ <br>
                    return x+y; <br>
                } <br>
                value= add(5,8);<br>
            </code>
            <p>Value would equal 13.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Bindings">
            <h2>Bindings</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Bindings hold values. They use a keyword, a name, and a value. Bindings can change value by using the
                assignment operator. The value of a binding without a value is undefined. Two diffrent bindings can
                have the same value.</p>
            <code>let value = 5;</code>
            <p>Let, var, and const can all be used as keywords to create bindings however var is not used much after
                ES6. </p>
            <h3>Prompt</h3>
            <p>To set a value as being equal to user input you need to use prompt().</p>
            <code>prompt(text, defaultText)</code>
            <p>It takes two parameters that are both strings. The first is the question that the user answers. The
                second is optional and it containes placeholder text. It returns whatever the user inputs. If they
                input nothing you get an empty string and if they hit cancel you get null.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="ArrayMethods">
            <h2>Array Methods</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Adding and Deleting Items</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>pop()</li>
                <p>Removes the last item and returns its value.</p>
                <p>No parameters.</p>
                <li>shift()</li>
                <p>Removes the first item and returns the removed item.</p>
                <p>No parameters.</p>
                <li>push()</li>
                <p>Adds an item to the end and retuns the new array lenght.</p>
                <p>The parameters are the items you want to add.</p>
                <li>unshift()</li>
                <p>Adds an item to the start and returns the lenght of the array.</p>
                <li>concat()</li>
                <p>This can combine two or more arrays. The arrays that you want to add should be passed as arguments.</p>
                <code>arr1.concat(arr2, arr3);</code>
                <p>This example would combine 3 arrays.
                </p>
                <li>splice()</li>
                <p>Splice has may parameters. The first is where the new elements should be added and the second is how
                    many elements should be deleted.</p>
                <p>For example 2 , 0 would place the elements after the first two and delete no elements.</p>
                <p>2 , 1 would place them after the first two elements and then delete the third.</p>
                <p>Every paramater after is an element that will be added.</p>
                <code>
                    let heros = ["Superman", "Wonderwoman", "Aquaman"];<br>
                    heros.splice(1,1, "Batman"); <br>
                </code>
                <p>This code will skip the first element which is Superman. Then it will delete one element being
                    Wonder Woman. Then it will add Batman after Superman. The result would be an array with Superman,
                    Batman, and Aquaman.</p>
                <li>slice()</li>
                <p>Slice will create a new array with parts of an existing array. It does not impact the inital array.</p>
                <p>Note that the parameters passed into slice represent the keys to the array and not the number of
                    their position. This means that the first element is 0 and the second is 1. </p>
                <code>
                    let arr1 = [1,2,3]; <br>
                    let arr2 = arr1.slice( 0, 1);<br> 
                </code>
                <p>In this example arr1 does not change but arr2 had 1 and 2 in it. </p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Math</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Math is an object but it is not a constructor. It has a few properties that are diffrent numbers like pi
                and Euler's number.</p>
            <code>Math.PI;<br>
                Math.E;

            <p>Math also has many methods. It has the trigonometric functions, max, min, round...</p>
            <p>The trigonometric functions are simple it is just the name and the parameter is the number you want to
                use.</p>
            <p>Max and Min are also simple they take a list of numbers as their parameter.</p>
            <p>Random has no parameters and will return a random number between 1 and 0. Round will round it to the
                nearest number. Floor
                will round down and ceil will round up.</p>
            <code>
                    Math.min(23, 1, 35, 88);
                    Math.random();<br>

        <section class="main-section" id="Date">
            <h2>Date</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Making Dates</h3>
            <p>Date is an object. You can create a date with the Date constructor. It has 7 parameters: year, month,
                day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond. Dates are stored in milliseconds.</p>
            <code>let today = new Date(); <br>
                let d = new Date(2018, 12, 14);
            </code>
            <h3>Date Methods</h3>
            <p>To display a date you need to change it into a string with the toString() method. Or you can use
                toDateString() which prints is in an easier to read format.</p>
            <code>console.log(today.toString());</code>
            <h3>Get Date Methods</h3>
            <p>There are many ways to get part of a date like getFullYear, getMonth, getDay... These will get you one
                part of the date. Note that they count from 0. so for getHour you will get a number from 0-23 and for
                getMonth you will get a number from 0-11.</p>
            <h3>Set Date Methods</h3>
            <p>Set Date methods work alot like get Date methods. They set the value of part of a date. The names are
                the same but they use set instead of
                get. They still count from 0.</p>
            <code>
                var today = new Date(); <br>
                today.setFullYear(2090); <br>
            </code>
            <p>In this example today is set to the current date and then in the next line the year is changed to 2090.</p>

            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>Events start with the word on. Some common events are onclick, onmouseover, </p>
            <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
            <p>Event Listeners allow you to add multiple functions to one event. These functions are added natively.
                They do not change the value of the event. This makes it faster because the code it read with the rest
                of the native JavaScript. You can not remove the functions once you made them because they are
                anonymous. The way to get around this is to make the function outside of the event. </p>

                <li>Target the object. You can do this with document.getElementById('name');</li>
                <li>Afterward write .addEventListener();.</li>
                <li>Then add an event without the on part in the (). So onclick would be just click. So it would be
                    .addEventListener("click");</li>
                <li>Make the next the parameter the function. Now it would be ("click", function(){console.log("Hello
                    World!");});</li>
                <li>To make another event you repeat the eariler steps.</li>
            </ol>
            <code>document.getElementById('name').addEventListener("click", function(){console.log("Hello
                    World!");});<br>
                    document.getElementById('name').addEventListener("click", function(){console.log("It's me again!");});
                </code>
            <h3>Removing an event!</h3>
            <p>If you made an event outside of the function and you added it then it can be removed!</p>
            <code> document.getElementById('name').addEventListener("click", helloWorld); //helloWorld is a function outside of the event. <br>
                document.getElementById('name').removeEventListener("click", helloWorld); //This can delete the function because it has a name

                </code>

            <h3>HTML Events</h3>
            <p>HTML events are not used much anymore because it is better to have your Javascript all together.</p>
            <h3>DOM On-Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>These are better than HTML events but you can only use one function so people tend to prefer event
                listeners. These events are attached to the object. The reason you can only have one function with this
                method is because you are changing the object property to a method and there is only one function
                allowed in a method. In the example below you are changing the onclick property to a method with the
                function that you are sett ing it equal to.</p>
            <h3>How to make an Event Handler!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Select an element. You can do this with document.getElementById('name');</li>
                <li>Type the name of the event that will trigger the function.</li>
                <li>Set the element.event equal to the function you want triggerd. NOTE: Do not call the function.</li>
            </ol>
            <code>document.getElementById('name').onclick = function(){console.log("Hello World!");};</code>

            <h3>These are always Falsy!!!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>false</li>
                <li>0</li>
                <li>""</li>
                <p>NOTE: An empty arrays, functions, and objects are truthy!</p>

            <p>If you use an if else statement and you have a falsy statement as the condition the else statement will
                run.</p>

            <h3>Loose equality!</h3>
            <p>true = true</p>
            <p>These are all equal : false = 0 == "" == []</p>
            <p>These equal each other and nothing else: null == undefined</p>
            <p>Infinity == Infinity & -Infinity == -Infinity</p>
            <p>NaN is not == to anything including itself!!!</p>

            <h3>Strict Equality</h3>
            <p>The two values must be the same to be true!!!</p>
            <p>NOTE: The exception is NaN which is still not equal to itself!</p>
            <code>
                false === 0; //false <br>
                NaN === NaN; //false <br>
                false === false; //true
